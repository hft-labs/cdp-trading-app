# BYOC: Build Your Own Coinbase

## Overview
This example application demostrates the power and completeness of the Coinbase Developer Platform by showcasing a fully functional DEX-based trading app — built entirely with CDP products. It's designed to prove a bold point: that you can now “Build Your Own Coinbase.”

**Alpha Software Warning**

> This project is in active development and is currently in an alpha state. It is not production-ready and should not be used for real funds or in public deployments. Features may change, break, or be removed at any time. Use at your own risk.

## Project Vision
By the end of July, developers should be able to launch a self-custodied, onchain trading app that mirrors many features of Coinbase’s core functionality — but built in the open, on Base, and powered exclusively by:

- **Embedded Wallets** – for user custody and key management
- **Onramp** – for fiat-to-crypto funding
- **Swap API / Contract Calls** – to trade assets
- **Balances API** – to show token holdings
- **SQL API** – for analytics and charting
